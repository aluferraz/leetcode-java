//It is a sweltering summer day, and a boy wants to buy some ice cream bars. 
//
// At the store, there are n ice cream bars. You are given an array costs of 
//length n, where costs[i] is the price of the iᵗʰ ice cream bar in coins. The boy 
//initially has coins coins to spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as 
//possible. 
//
// Return the maximum number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with coins coins.
// 
//
// Note: The boy can buy the ice cream bars in any order. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: costs = [1,3,2,4,1], coins = 7
//Output: 4
//Explanation: The boy can buy ice cream bars at indices 0,1,2,4 for a total 
//price of 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: costs = [10,6,8,7,7,8], coins = 5
//Output: 0
//Explanation: The boy cannot afford any of the ice cream bars.
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: costs = [1,6,3,1,2,5], coins = 20
//Output: 6
//Explanation: The boy can buy all the ice cream bars for a total price of 1 + 6
// + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 18.
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// costs.length == n 
// 1 <= n <= 10⁵ 
// 1 <= costs[i] <= 10⁵ 
// 1 <= coins <= 10⁸ 
//
