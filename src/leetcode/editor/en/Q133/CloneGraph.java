//Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph. 
//
// Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. 
//
// Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its 
//neighbors. 
//
// 
//class Node {
//    public int val;
//    public List<Node> neighbors;
//}
// 
//
// 
//
// Test case format: 
//
// For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed)
//. For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and 
//so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list. 
//
// An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a 
//finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph. 
//
// The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return 
//the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
// 
// 
//Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
//Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
//Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
//1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
//2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
//3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
//4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
// 
//
// Example 2: 
// 
// 
//Input: adjList = [[]]
//Output: [[]]
//Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists 
//of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: adjList = []
//Output: []
//Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100]. 
// 1 <= Node.val <= 100 
// Node.val is unique for each node. 
// There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph. 
// The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given 
//node. 
//
